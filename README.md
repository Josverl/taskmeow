# React CosmosDB

This is my implementation of Burke Holland's great React CosmoDB sample.

[![Build Status](https://ydogandjiev.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/35dab36f-5d13-406c-afa8-9b2b906763c4/3/badge)](https://ydogandjiev.visualstudio.com/taskmeow/_build/index?definitionId=3)

## Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ydogandjiev/react-cosmosdb.git
cd react-cosmosdb
yarn install
```

## Running The App

The template can be run in development, or in production. For development, use the following workflow.

### Start Create React App and Express Server

```bash
yarn start
```

## Building For Production

In production, you want Express to serve up your app.

### Build React App

```bash
yarn build
```

Now simply visit the Express app at 'http://localhost:3001' and you will see your app served from the 'build' folder. That's all there is to it!
